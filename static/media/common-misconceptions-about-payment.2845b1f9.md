### Common Misconceptions About Payment

>1)Sketch: ... describes itself as the all-in-one designer's toolkit. It has attempted to cover the entire design process. It has also made a point of working with your other software and comes with over 700 extensions â€“ assistants, plugins, and integrations. Sketch began as a Mac-only app but has now evolved to include a web app with tools that work in any web browser. It still doesn't have a native Windows app, however.

> 2)Adobe XD: All designers will know of Adobe graphic products, such as Photoshop and Illustrator, industry leaders in many categories. These flagship apps are part of Adobe's Creative Cloud and are helpful to UX/UI designers. For example, you can use Photoshop to edit, composite, and create images, graphics, and art. Adobe Illustrator is excellent for creating vector art and illustrations.

>3) Figma:... connects everyone in the design process so teams can deliver better products faster. Figma is an all-in-one design platform. In addition, the company has an associated tool, FigJam, that acts as an online whiteboard for teams. Figma is excellent for design, prototyping, and design systems. UX/UI designers can then, in turn, use FigJam to collaborate and map out the design processes. Similarly, its Arc tool means you can quickly design clocks, watch screens, or pie charts.

>4)Balsamiq: ... is a UI wireframing tool that reproduces the experience of sketching on a notepad or whiteboard on a computer. You can use it to think and communicate about the structure of the software or website you're building. Of course, you will want to find a good interface structure before you finalize your visual design or write any code. Balsamiq forces you to focus on structure and content rather than being distracted by colors and other details too early.

>5)InVision Freehand: ... is a centralized online whiteboard. While it has many uses within an organization, it is particularly beneficial for your design teams. You can connect every phase of design with an inclusive, collaborative hub. Indeed, you can even bring stakeholders and users directly into the design process. You can centralize your design work by adding Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch artboards directly into Freehand if you use these tools.
