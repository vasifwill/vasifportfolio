### 3 Things To Know About Startup Business

>1)Redux: ...is an open-source library released a couple of years after React that uses the concept of a data “store” to help keep track of the state of the application. Although in React you can share state data across components, it is sometimes difficult to do so efficiently, especially for complex applications. In Redux, all components have direct access to the same stores, which makes it easier to pass state between different parts of the application.
>MobX: ... is an open-source library that manages state in a different way than Redux, and is less widely used. But MobX abstracts a lot of the complexity of state management away from developers, which gives developers an advantage both when they are learning to use the library and also when building simple applications. Generally, developers will end up writing less code using MobX to manage state.
>3)React Hooks: ...are a more recent addition to the suite of React tools. They were added in React version 16.8.0 and offer another way to handle state management that eliminates much of the need for writing classes to manipulate state. Working with hooks can compress much of the additional code developers have to write to get state data, but hooks also have more complexity when applications themselves become more complex. That can sometimes make writing tests for front-end code more difficult.
>4)Create React App: Developers can use the Create React App tool to spin up a new React app instead of spending time tracking down the necessary libraries and configuring them manually. The newly created app comes with a clean folder structure for all the application’s files and also React scripts for running and deploying the code. In addition, the tool makes it easier to incorporate testing into the development process early on.
>5)Next.js: React was developed primarily to support complex applications tasked with a lot of front-end calculations, which is why the Create React App generator only supports client-side rendering. Client-side rendering means the application uses front-end JavaScript code to decide what should be displayed to the user at any given moment, a React framework specialty. The Next.js generator, on the other hand, allows developers to spin up React applications that either do client-side or server-side rendering. With server-side rendering, the application does all the necessary calculations to decide what to display to the user on the server before even sending the HTML page to the user’s browser. There are several advantages to server-side rendering: It’s good for performance because the front-end code basically displays static pages, and it’s also good for SEO because crawlers are able to find server-side code easier than client-side code.
